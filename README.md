In Rearden AI wee are building an open source and user-owned web3 agents protocol where powerful models (aka Llama 3 70B) and massive knowledge bases (like blockchain state or github repositories) are hosted by the network operators. 

Preserving user data, intents and actions are privately executed on the client side, Rearden AI feeds agents with trustless data and enterprise level models inference.
